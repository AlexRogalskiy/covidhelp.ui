## Quick Guide to add a new language/locale

Suppose you want to add Telugu. (te)

1. Create a fork of the repo, clone it.
2. Create a new file in `lang` directory called `te_IN.js`
3. Copy contents from `lang/en_US.js`
4. Add translation of the language for every string.
5. Open `nuxt.config.js` and add the locale details to `i18n.locales`.
6. Commit, Push, and Create a Pull Request.
